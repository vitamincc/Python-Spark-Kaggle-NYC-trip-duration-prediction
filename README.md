cs657: Assignment 3

Do this assignment in SPARK

Prepare the data: There are 10 attributes plus the target -trip_duration- (read the description). See if any should be eliminated or transformed. (Use your judgement.)
Use regresion to train a model that can predict the duration. Do this in the following ways:
Using a version of regression that optimizes the parameters with Gradient Descent.
Using a version of regression that optimizes the parameters with Stochastic Gradient Descent
Produce a graph of time to train vs. size of the training set to compare both methods
Add regularization to the model. Try L1 and L2. Compare the results with the previous, unregularized models.
For all the models you produce above, use a percentage of the training set (80%) to crossvalidate your model (10 folds). Use the rest of the data (20%) as test set. Output the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error. (You cannot use the test data in Kaggle because you do not know the labels.)
